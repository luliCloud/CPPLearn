"Zap" generally means to destroy, hit, or obliterate something quickly 
and effectively. It can also refer to using a sudden burst of energy or 
force to achieve something, like zapping a stain with a cleaner or zapping 
through tasks quickly. In a more technical or slang context, "zap" could 
mean to strike with a beam or ray, such as in science fiction, where a 
weapon might zap a target with energy.
